Welcome to IFOM0!

We are an [intersectional](../intersectionality) feminist collective in Manchester created by immigrant women and queer individuals who seek to build a community of introspective and extroverted actions. We meet up weekly at the same time and place, as a way to create a "στέκι" (in Greek steki = a gathering place) for personal growth, mutual support, empowerment, and to process the world through intersectional feminism. Our initials stand for Intersectional Feminist of Manchester 0 (zero), as a word-play of FOMO (=fear of missing out) and zero, as in we start from zero. 

We aim at fostering a non-judgmental and safe space where we can connect, learn, create and organise together. We believe in community building through experiential learning, listening to and learning from each other, and finding joy in the process. Through common study groups, artistic expression, and shared dialogues, we explore feminist ideas and practices, gaining insights from our unique standpoints. We want to support each other and create a community where we can not only be heard but also learn to listen with open hearts. We value empowerment, safety, and the transformative potential of coming together - whether it’s through art, words or simply gathering to exist as we are. In this collective, we find joy, solidarity, and the power to envision and create a more equitable, just and inclusive world.
